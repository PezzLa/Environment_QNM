# Environment QNMs

Mathematica notebooks to evaluate Quasi-Normal Modes for Axial ($s=\pm 2$) perturbations of Schwarzschild Black Holes embedded in a DM halo. These codes provide a generalization to the Matrix Method (main method in [arxiv : 1610.08135 v4]) and WKB approximation for numerical matter distributions.
